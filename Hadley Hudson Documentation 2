Today I played around on R studio with the new information that Dr. Absher had wanted me to try on my Macbook. Under the packages tab in the bottom right of RStudio, I clicked install and inputted a tar.gz file so that I could select ADNIMERGE_0.0.1.tar.gz from the ADNI folder in Dropbox. After this installed, I was able to check the ADNIMERGE box in the packages tab. I then went through and checked all the boxes by the packages listed in Dr. Absher's code. With these installed, I am now able to input variables into RStudio. 
I am meeting with Dr. Absher tonight so that I can obtain some guidance on my next steps.
