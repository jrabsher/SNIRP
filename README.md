## SNIRP
#Summer NeuroImaging Research Program

The SNIRP program is designed to give students an opportunity to develop novel neuroimaging research projects, or to work on an existing project with a mentor. The SNIRP program is now in its third year at Prisma Health-Upstate.

This Git repository will help to teach SNIRP students how to use reproducible science tools such as code versioning.

By the way, feel free to interact with students and offer assistance. I'm sure they will learn from the Git community, too.
